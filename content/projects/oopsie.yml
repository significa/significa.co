              title: Market Research
              text: We travelled halfway across the world to Hong Kong, to better understand their ways. The city is packed, traffic is jamming everywhere, restaurants are crowded with people, enormous queues exiting the main door. Very often people just quickly grab something, go back to the office, have lunch at their own desk and swiftly get back to work. A unique lifestyle that had a drastic impact on the core features of the Oopsie App.

              text: We visited many local restaurants, got into their kitchens, and interviewed their staff and managers. We understood from inside out how they operate and how they deal with take aways. A true privilege that gave us an opportunity to do something different for the industry. We would reduce queues on restaurant doors while keeping their revenue stream and allowing their customers to skip those endless queues.

Where to get it, when to get it, and most importantly, what to get. With only a few clicks, users are able to find their favourite restaurants and order their favourite food.

              text: With Oopsie, users can start browsing restaurants immediately. As the most likely of scenarios, it made sense to preset the pickup time for “now” and the location for “nearby” as restaurants will appear based on proximity. With a few clicks and without losing context, the user can quickly change this by accessing the pickup menu. Here the user can type an address or use the map to pinpoint a specific location. A birds-eye-view that, at a glance, due to a clever choice of color, allows users to immediately understand which restaurants are open nearby or on the way to their destination.

That is why, after some important real world feedback, we opted for a mandatory signup with a phone number. Not only is it an immediate way to validate an account, it’s also a very convenient way for restaurants to contact users directly with urgent order updates.

                As we added schedule-sensitive menus to the app, the restaurant page needed an overhaul. This meant replacing the native placement of the restaurant name on the header with the order pickup time as it affects all the content below. Because of the dual-language characteristics of the Hong Kong region, it was also essential to allow the user to quickly change the language right there on the menus.

                Craving some cart noodles? Different soup flavours, various sorts of noodles and endless possibilities for toppings are only a few of the possible customisations you can normally do to your dishes in Hong Kong. To allow users to fully customise dishes with this level of complexity, we had to rethink the entire functionality and created a clever & intuitive counter flow! Just tap to add!
