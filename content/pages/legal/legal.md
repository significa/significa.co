### Where we store your personal data

Significa is incorporated in Portugal. We primarily store and process your personal data in the EU. Any data may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.

Some examples of reasons your data may be processed outside of the EEA include:

- Technical support services.
- Customer support services.

If your personal data cannot be processed within the EEA, we will:

- Comply with all other data protection principles.
- Where possible, be to a country that is on the list of the EU Commission's countries that provide adequate protections for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.
- If the transfer is to the United States of America, we will use reasonable endeavours to make sure they participate in the Privacy Shield program.

### Is the information collected through the service secure?

We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorised access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.

### Who might Significa share your information with?

Significa may share anonymised data not linked to any personal identification information with third parties, either because you have consented to allow us to do so or for contractual or legal reasons. For example, we may share your personal information with:
Subcontractors and third parties for the purpose of the performance of a contract that we hold with them or that we hold with you.
With third parties because you have given consent.

Other reasons Significa may share your personal information with a third party – Significa will share your personal data with third parties for the following reasons:

- If Significa must comply with a legal obligation.
- To enforce or apply our Website Terms of Use or other agreements.
- To protect the rights, property, or safety of Significa, our clients or others.
