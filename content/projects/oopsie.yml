      title: Market Research
      text: |
        We travelled halfway across the world to Hong Kong, to better understand their ways. The city is packed, traffic is jamming everywhere, restaurants are crowded with people, enormous queues exiting the main door. Very often people just quickly grab something, go back to the office, have lunch at their own desk and swiftly get back to work. A unique lifestyle that had a drastic impact on the core features of the Oopsie App.

        We visited many local Restaurants, got into their kitchens, interviewed their staff and managers. We understood from inside out how they operate and how they deal with take aways. A true privilege that gave us an opportunity to do something different for the industry. We would reduce queues on restaurant doors while keeping their revenue stream and allowing their customers to skip those endless queues.

      title: Core Product Decisions
      text: |
        With wireframes (low-fi simplified designs that allow you to get a full scope of the entire app), we tackled app specific flows and went deep into interactions without compromising core product decisions from the get go.

        This allowed us to separate the nice-to-have from the must-have, getting closer and closer to creating an MVP — a Minimum Viable Product. For Oopsie, this meant excluding delivery and focusing exclusively on users picking up their food directly from restaurants.

        With these decisions, Oopsie begun to take shape and the app started to become a reality. For an in-depth look at this meticulous process have a read on a series of articles written by Rui Sereno, partner at Significa, involved directly on every decision with the client.

      title: Oopsie Branding
      text: |
        With such a fierce competition from the food delivery industry, the Oopsie brand needed to stand out from the crowd. With that in mind, we set out to create a recognisable brand with a modern logo and a unique set of characters.

      title: The Oopsie App
      text: |
        Designed natively & avaliable for both iOS and Android, the Oopsie app allows users to focus entirely on food. Where to get it, when to get it, and most importantly, what to get. With only a few clicks, the users should be able to find their favorite restaurants and order their favourite food.

        Immediately, when the users open the app, they can start browsing restaurants. Over time, analytics told us that users like to order frequently from the same restaurants. For convenience sake, we highlighted the users’ last orders and their favorite restaurants directly on the home tab.

        As the most likely of scenarios, it made sense to preset the pickup time for “now” and the location for “nearby”.  With a few clicks and without the user losing context users can quickly change the pickup settings.  Content slides down so that users can focus entirely on their decision. Done? The content slides back up with the updated list of restaurants.

        If the users want to get a birds-eye-view of the restaurants avaliable in a certain area, they can use Oopsie’s map feature to see which ones are more convenient for pickup. At a glance, due to a clever choice of color, users can immediately understand which restaurants are open nearby or on the way to their destination.

      title: Authentication
      text: |
        The Oopsie app and the service it provides relies heavily on direct contact between restaurants and users. That is why we opted for a mandatory signup with a phone number. Not only is it an immediate way to validate an account, it’s also a very convenient way for restaurants to contact users directly with urgent order updates.

        The user is in, but how do we make him stay? First impressions matter, so we created a place where restaurants can have some real appetizing photographs of both their food and their facilities. Information is always within eye reach, so that users can, at a glance, quickly scan the important information. This meant replacing the native placement of the restaurant name on the header with the order pickup time.

        Copouns can be offered by restaurants, or earned by signing up to Oopsie and referring it to friends. But how could we make them fun? With such a powerful branding behind the app, this was the perfect place to add the excentric and colorful Oopsies!

        The reverse side of the Oopsie coin. When the user places an order, restaurants receive it immediately in their own iOS Restaurant app for iPad. A seamless integration that is the core of the Oopsie ecosystem.
